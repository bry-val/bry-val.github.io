<p>In these visualizations I have combined some data from the following dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores - This dataset contains multiple files that have various kinds of information. In my analysis I used the players, appearances, and competition tables. The players table had information about each player, such as their place of birth and what club they play for. The appearances table contained information about all the appearances for all players in the clubs listed in the dataset. Each appearance is equal to one row. I was able to join these two tables to see what players made what appearances, and this allowed me to join their information such as what club and country they represent. Finally, I joined the competition table as well as it allowed me to see what league they played in. I ended up not using this information, but I preferred to have more data and then let me prune it later as I saw fit.</p>

<p>My visualization has three aspects. A scatter plot, and two histograms. The scatter plot shows the spread/dsitribution of goals and assist per country, while the histogram is linked to the scatterplots view and allows you to see more specific numbers per the countries that you can see in the scatterplot. You can get very granular and focus on one, or you can zoom out all the way and get the big picture about what teams in the FIFA top 20 rankings are historically the strongest.</p>

<p>Finally, my plots aesthetic is clean and simple. I chose to not overcomplicate the colors because I believe that these colors are good enough at differentiating. I chose to do the top 20 countries rather than all 170+ countries in the dataset because it would have been way too many countries and would have been very messy looking. I would like some suggestions about how to do this better. And maybe some ideas about a way that I could include more countries while keeping the clean and minimal aesthetic.</p>

<p>One relevant visualization comes from FIFA <img src="https://i.ibb.co/vDpBtxN/Animation.gif" alt="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/men?dateId=id13792" title="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/men?dateId=id13792" /> https://Captured from www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/men?dateId=id13792</p>

<p>In this table, they visually represent the team rankings that allowed me to know what the top 20 teams were, at least according to FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association).</p>

<p>Another interesting visualization that comes from SOCCERNET.ESPN.GO.COM can be found here: <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4140/4788997630_7278761998_b.jpg" alt="SOCCERNET.ESPN.GO.COM" title="SOCCERNET.ESPN.GO.COM" /> This is an interesting visualization that shows the total population and nominal GDP per capita for each country in the 2010 world cup. I would like to maybe do a visualization like this in the future as it is very aesthetic and insighftul.</p>
